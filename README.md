Node.js Express Hello World Local CI Pipeline

This project demonstrates a local CI/CD pipeline using Docker for a Node.js + Express app.
The pipeline builds, lints, tests, and deploys the app in a container. We used the same node.js Expresshello world app with Dockerfilw which we used in the Task-1.
